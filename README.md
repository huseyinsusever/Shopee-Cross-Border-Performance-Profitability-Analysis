# 🛍️ Shopee Cross-Border Performance & Profitability Analysis
### *Business Intelligence Project for E-commerce Growth & Stability*

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of cross-border e-commerce data to identify high-profit product segments and stabilize stock management. Built with **Python** and **SQL**, it directly addresses Shopee’s core KPIs: **Profitability, Market Stability, and Cross-Border Efficiency.**

## 🏗️ Technical Workflow (Python & SQL Integration)

I designed this project to demonstrate a dual-track analytical approach:

1. **Feature Engineering (Python/Pandas):** Derived the `Total Revenue` metric by processing raw `Quantity` and `UnitPrice` data to uncover real business value.
2. **Data Governance (SQL/SQLite):** Transferred processed data into a relational SQL database to simulate an enterprise-grade BI environment.
3. **Advanced Querying:** Leveraged complex SQL queries to extract regional performance insights, ensuring high data integrity.
